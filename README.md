## Additional information
1. Since I had to write an application that needs to support SSR,
   I used getServerSideProps. And it just so happened that I didn't
   need a global state, but I added reduxjs/toolkit to demonstrate
   my ability to work with it (dead code).
2. I usually write in a multi-paradigm style, but I am familiar
   with the concept of functional programming. Unfortunately, I didn't
   have enough time to familiarize myself with the Ramda.js or lodash/fp
   libraries. But on the other hand, I got acquainted with Next.js and
   styled-components from scratch, in two days at a sufficient
   (to complete the task) level!
